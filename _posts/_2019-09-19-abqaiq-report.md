**The Attack on Abqaiq from Space**

On September 14, 2019 there was an attack on the state-owned [Saudi Aramco][1] (TADAWUL) company's oil processing facilities at Abqaiq. The attack caused massive fires which were visible from the city. This again provides a good opportunity to observe the size and effect of the damage caused on global oil supply.

Although not much visible from space, some smoke can be observed from optical satellite imagery even on the morning of September 15th, 2019.

The question is then; *Abqaiq being one of the largest facilities on the globe, how did this affect the supply?*

Novit.AI can answer that question both visually and with numbers. Novit.AI's **Shlep Live** tracks world's largest oil processing facilities, production centres, key strategic ports and canals for transporting oil. By having this information an analysis can be made about the geospatial supply and demand based on factual data.
